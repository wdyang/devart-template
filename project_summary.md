# Project Title
Bubble Connection

## Authors

## Description
The city is filled with people, and yet we rarely look at strangers. With Bubble Connection, we will install motion sensitive displays in several cities. The displays normally looks like a mirror, but when a person walks by, his movement opens up a bubble, revealing somebody in another city, who happens to be in front of another display. The installation encourages people to look into eyes of total stranger from totally different culture, sensing that we are all connected no matter how far apart and how different our cultures are.
