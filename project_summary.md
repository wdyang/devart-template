# Project Title
Ink Connectivity

## Authors

## Description
What if we connect through a surrogate of ink spreading in water?
This project is both a distributed interactive installation and a interactive remote performance system. In it's simplest set up, two cameras and two monitors are setup in two locations, a person's movement will generate ink movement both local and remote, the person in the other end can respond, which will also create ink movement in both locations.

## Images & Videos

Early prototype experiment with the code. Currently using recorded video and implemented in Openframeworks with ofxFluid. Planning on moving to webGL and using socket.io for realtime remote interactivity.
